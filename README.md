# Fine-Tuning-VGG-16
### Fine Tuned For CIFAR-100 
![conv-layers-vgg16](https://github.com/secrakib/Fine-Tuning-VGG-16/assets/102784469/136e669b-68a6-45f8-bd96-803bcac6a041)

# Purpose Of This Project
- To learn and Hands On about Pre-Tranied Models.
- To Learn About **Pytorch** ðŸ”¦
  
## Difficulty Faced 
- As Vgg-16 is a very Deep Neural Network Model Training even 1 Epoch in Google Colab Takes a Long Time even with T4 GPU.
- Can't Train the Model after 1 epoch as Google Colab was Frequently Shutting Down Operation  

# Pre-Trained Model Variations
1. Freezed Convulation Layers Weights  
2. Freezed Fully Connected Layers Weights   
3. Developed Model From Scratch    
4. Using Pre-trained Model Weights
